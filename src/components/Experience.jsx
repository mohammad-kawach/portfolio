              During my time at DigitalEdge Company as a front-end developer and

              appealing and user-friendly websites that reflected the
              company&apos;s brand identity. Through responsive design
              techniques and custom React JS libraries, I optimized websites for
              seamless performance across multiple devices. My contributions in
              integrating user-generated content enhanced user engagement and
              fostered a vibrant online community.
