        <p>
          As a web developer, I am deeply passionate about exploring the latest
          advancements in front-end web development technologies. I dedicate a
          significant amount of my free time to staying up to date with emerging
          trends, frameworks, and libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to entertainment, I am particularly drawn to sci-fi and
          fantasy genres, as they often inspire me to think creatively and push
          the boundaries of what is possible in technology. I enjoy watching
          sci-fi and fantasy movies and television shows, not only for
          entertainment but also to draw inspiration for my web development
          projects.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          Overall, my interests revolve around the intersection of technology
          and creativity, both in my professional work and personal pursuits.
