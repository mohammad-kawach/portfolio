  BACHELORS_DEGREE: {
    FIELD_OF_STUDY: "IT - Software Engineering",
    UNIVERSITY: "Al-Baath University",
    DEGREE_LEVEL: "Bachelor Degree",
    DESCRIPTION: `At Al-Baath University, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in IT - Software Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I had the opportunity to delve into a wide range of courses that equipped me with a strong foundation in various aspects of software engineering.

      One of the key areas of study was Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), where I gained a deep understanding of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. I also learned different algorithms and techniques for efficient problem-solving, such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal algorithms.

      In addition to DSA, I delved into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which provided me with a solid understanding of the principles and concepts behind building modular and reusable software components. Through hands-on projects and assignments, I honed my skills in designing classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling me to develop robust and maintainable software solutions.

      Another significant aspect of my coursework was the exploration of software design patterns. I learned about various design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and MVC (Model-View-Controller), which offered me valuable insights into architecting scalable and maintainable software applications. Understanding these design patterns allowed me to tackle complex software design challenges effectively.

      Moreover, my education at Al-Baath University encompassed other crucial subjects, including database management systems, web development, software testing methodologies, operating systems, and computer networks. These courses broadened my knowledge and skills in areas essential for modern software engineering.

      Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to work on collaborative projects, participate in coding competitions, and engage in practical assignments that further reinforced my understanding of the theoretical concepts. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience gained from these courses has prepared me to tackle real-world software engineering challenges with confidence.

      Overall, my education at Al-Baath University provided me with a comprehensive understanding of software engineering principles and equipped me with the necessary skills to design, develop, and maintain high-quality software systems. The knowledge and experiences gained from my coursework have been instrumental in shaping my career as a software engineer.`,
